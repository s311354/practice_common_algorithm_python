#### Population Count ####

The population count of a specific value is the number of set bits in that value. Calculating the population count efficiently has been widely studied with implementation existing for both software and hardware. Many of the popular microprocessors also provide hardware support for this operation.

#### Setting a Bit ####

Use the bitwise OR operator (|) to set a bit

#### Clear a Bit ####

Use the bitwise AND operator (&) to clear a bit

#### Toggle a Bit ####

Use the bitwise XOR operator (^) to toggle a bit

#### Parity Check Bit ####

is commonly used for the simplest scheme of error detection.

#### Parity Bit ####

In mathematics parity can refer to the evenness or oddness of an integer, which, when written in its binary form, can be determined just by examining only its least significant bit.
